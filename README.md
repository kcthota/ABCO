# Alt-Bank Coin Offerings

TD;DR - Instead of taking real estate, student or personal loans from banks, users can issue “coins” and payback rent, portion of income as dividend to coin holders. The coins can appreciate or depreciate based on the performance of underlying asset (house, person).

Companies have multiple ways to raise money to fuel the growth. They can get money via debt or they can sell stake to potential investors who think that the company would do better in future. Why can’t we apply the same principle to individuals? Individuals who are in need of money now are limited to getting loans from banks or financial institutions. Why can’t an individual raise money from potential investors so the individual can use that money for a better purpose now and “promise” to return back portion of earnings.

**The rise of ICOs:**

Companies are raising money by offering ICOs. These coins can be used for consumption of services offered by the company or they can further be traded. The coins do not mean anything except the perceived value of the investors.

Similar to how the companies are raising the money, a single person, a family can also offer coins against assets he own, salary he draws or potential wealth he can acquire in future. These coins can serve as an alternative to debt available to individuals from banks.

**Real Estate Coin Offerings:**

In contrast to the current house loans or refinancing, an individual, a family, a group of persons or a company would offer coins for a percentage ownership in a real estate asset. Such coins received by the investors can be traded on a platform. Based on the demand for the underlying asset the coin values can go up or down in the market.

And since the underlying asset in a real estate which can generate rent, the holders of the coins would receive “rent dividend” every month, quarter, half-year, year or any term as defined by the coin offering.

For example: If John owns a house currently worth $500,000 and is in immediate need of $100,000. John can offer an coin offering for $100000 against 20% ownership in his house. Also he agrees to pay $400 rent every month for the 20% owners who will hold the coins and the rent would be inflation adjusted every year.

Investors who think the underlying asset could appreciate and interested in receiving the “rent dividend” would purchase the coins via the coin offering. Users who purchase these coins can hold these coins to receive “rent dividend” or can trade/sell these coins to other investors or sell back to John if he offers a buy back.

John can continue to pay the rent for the 20% ownership he gave up. He can also buy back a portion or all the coins by offering a premium on top of the trading value of the coins. The house cannot be sold until the coins are bought back.

**Student Coin Offerings:**

Education is not free in many countries. Many students who have excellent grades and secure admission to prestigious universities had to give up their dreams as they cannot afford the cost of tuition and other costs involved. 

Student Coin Offerings allow a student to raise money required for financing the education by offering coins for sale against a percentage ownership in his potential earnings. The holder of the coins would receive “Earnings dividend” at a predetermined interval as defined in the coin offering. These coins can further be traded on the platform. The coins can appreciate or depreciate in value in the market based on the earnings potential of the individual. The coin offering can also offer to protect the investors by purchasing a life insurance policy for the individual.

For example, a student named Lisa secured admission to study MD at Stanford School of Medicine which can cost $300,000 with the potential of earning $175000 starting salary once she completes her education. She offers a coin offering for 3% of her earnings until she buys back the coins.

Investors can purchase the coins from Lisa and receive “earnings dividend” from Lisa’s future earnings. Since the underlying asset offered by coins is Lisa’s education and her potential to earn more in future, over time dividends would go up and the value of these coins go up. Lisa can offer premium on top of the coin value and buy back the coins at any time.

**Personal Coin Offerings:**

An individual can also offer coins for sale by offering a portion of his salary for the coin holders. The coin holder would start to receive “Earnings dividend” at a predetermined interval as defined by the coin offering. These coins can further be traded on the platform. The coins can appreciate or depreciate in value in the market based on the earnings potential of the individual. The coin offering can also offer to protect the investors by purchasing a life insurance policy.

For example, Jeff works a Software Engineer and currently earns a salary of $150,000. He is in immediate need of $25,000 for a personal expense. He offers coins for sale to give 1% of his salary as divided to the coin holders.

Until the coins are in circulation, Jeff would continue to pay 1% of his salary $125 per month as dividend. The dividend may go up as Jeff progresses through his career. If he moves to a new job that pays $200,000, he would pay $166.67 per month as dividend. At any point Jeff can offer to buy back the coins by offering a premium on top of traded value in the markets.


**Additional notes:**

* Legal implications and enforceability of such contracts is unknown.

* Depending on the underlying the asset, max percentages of the ownership that can be offered may be defined. For example, a person may not offer more than 20% of his earnings in student or personal coin offerings. If a user gives up 100% of his earning potential, there is no incentive for the person to work any more.

* Verification mechanisms need to be established to ensure investors are not defrauded. One mechanism could be that personal earnings must be certified by a CPA.

* Not paying dividends or not filing the earnings statements should affect the credit of the person.

* If multiple such platform are available, there should be a mechanism to identify how much investment has already been raised for the underlying asset.

* Bankruptcy, natural disasters, death of underlying coin person may result in complete loss of value of the coins.
